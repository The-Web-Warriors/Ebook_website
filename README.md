# Ebook_website
This is our project for devjam. We used HTML5 and CSS3 to make a webpage so that people can easily read newspaper and have the necessary  magazines to continue their preparations. We are aiming to make a large library of books on our website so that we can easily read them anywhere and free of cost.
